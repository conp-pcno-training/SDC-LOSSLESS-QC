The waveform doesn't suggest cortical activity and the overlay shows that removing this component only appears to remove the artefacts without visibly removing any good cortical data. Removing the component is the best decision here.

> > At 1141 seconds, there is what appears to be an artefact in component 11. However when looking at the EEG channel data, there is no significant artefact at this time point. Using the projected overlay is particularly helpful for determining that data with the remaining components is clean. Because the EEG channel data appears to be within a reasonable range across all channels at that time point, we can leave the component and time period in.

> > During the time periods around 585-587 seconds and 597-599 seconds, there are several components that contain artefacts. For these time periods, we would answer no to the first question because several components that have artefacts are not flat. For the second question, we would answer yes because several channels are being affected by these artefacts in the scalp EEG data. For the third question, we would answer yes because there are multiple components with artefacts during this time period. In this example, we would prefer to flag the time period for removal over removing every component that has an artefact. We would have to remove too many components in order to clean up this time period so it is better to remove the time period instead. We can also use the orange AMICA marks to help make this decision. The lighter highlight that is seen during this time period indicates that the three parallel AMICA procedures did not replicate during this time period. The orange AMICA bar is oftern lighter during artefactual time periods so this mark can be used as an indicator of artefactual time periods.

> > The top cortical components are mixed with slow waves (sweat artefacts). This is an ambiguous case because on the one hand we definitely want to remove the sweat artefacts, but on the other hand we don't want to remove any cortical data. In this case we would lean towards removing these components, but we ultimately need to decide whether or not too much good cortical data appears to be removed from the scalp waveforms based on visual inspection of the projected overlay.
> >     
> > If we use the flow chart on the top two components, we would answer no to the first question because the rest of the components aren't flat. We would answer yes to the second question because the artefacts are substantially affecting the EEG channel data, and we would answer no to the third question because for most of the time periods, it is only two components that have large artefacts. The components contain artefacts that are continually affecting the EEG channel data, so we would answer yes to question 4, which leads to marking the components as ambiguous and flagging them for removal. The artefacts are occurring too often, so removing the time period for each artefact is not an option. Although the component does appear to contain what appears to be good cortical data, in this case it is best to remove these components because the resulting projection does not appear to visibly affect areas of good cortical signal, meaning we are losing little to no cortical signal by removing these components.

This is affecting many good channels throughout the entire recording, and also removing the artefact does not appear to affect the cortical signal when inspecting the overlay in the channel scroll plot, so it is best to remove the component.

Removing these components would likely be removing good cortical data, so in this case it would be best to remove the time period instead.

The topographical data suggests that this is likely an eye component and the overlay waveforms are not affected much by removing this component other than getting rid of the artefact from the affected channels. The best decision here would be to remove the component.
