title: "Running the Quality Control Script"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How do I run the quality control procedure?"
- "What does the quality control procedure look like?"
objectives:
- "Understand how to start the quality control procedure."
- "Become familiar with the figures displayed during quality control."
keypoints:
- "The input is `*.edf` files."
- "The output is `*desc-qc*` files which contain the annotation information."

1. Open MATLAB (pre-2014b works fastest) and change your **Current Folder** by navigating to the Lossless pipeline root directory (in this case, `Face13`).

2. Open EEGLAB by typing the following into the command window:

    ```matlab
    >> addpath derivatives/BIDS-Lossless-EEG/code/install
    >> lossless_path
    >> eeglab
    ```

3. If you are using an older version of MATLAB (pre-2014b), you will need to set the default figure renderer to OpenGL by typing the following into the command window:

   
    ```matlab
    >> set(0,'DefaultFigureRenderer','OpenGL');
    ```

4. In the main EEGLAB window, navigate to **File->Vised Configuration**. 

    ![Vised Config Dropdown Menu]({{ page.root }}/fig/visedconfig_dropdown.png)

5. Add the vised configuration file by clicking `| Load vised config |` and then navigate to the config folder (`derivatives/BIDS-Lossless-EEG/code/config/`). Select the file named `vised_config_qc.cfg`, and click `| OK |`. The vised configuration file will load certain settings that are preferable for the QC procedure.

6. In the main EEGLAB window, navigate to **File->Batch->Run History Template Batch**.


7. In the **Run History Template Batch** window, add a Context configuration file by clicking `| Load context config |`. The default file will be sufficient for this task: `derivatives/BIDS-Lossless-EEG/code/config/contextconfig.cfg`. 

8. Click `| History File |` and add the `qc.htb` script located in `derivatives/BIDS-Lossless-EEG/code/scripts/`.

9. Open up a terminal window, and navigate to your `BIDS-Lossless-EEG` directory:

    `>> cd path/to/project/directory/Face13/derivatives/BIDS-Lossless-EEG`

10. In the terminal, list all the data files youâ€™d like to run through the pipeline. This can be done using the find command. If using the BIDS directory structure, simply type:

    `>> find . -name "*.edf"`

11. This will print a list of all the files that have run through the pipeline, which you can then copy straight from the terminal into the **file** field in the **Run History Template Batch** window, with one path/filename per line.

12. In the **path** field in the **Run History Template Batch** window, type `derivatives/BIDS-Lossless/EEG`. The history template batch window should look like this:

 ![RunHTB]({{ page.root }}/fig/runhtb.png)

13. Click `| Ok |` to start the QC batch process.

14. Once you click `| Ok |`, the QC windows will open for your first file. The files will open in alphabetical order. Several windows will open for each file you QC, including: 

    <span style="color:red">A.</span> A window that displays the **component** EEG data. This is the window that you will be interacting with as you QC. You will be making your decisions in this window by adding or removing a manual mark for components or time points. Components are sorted by the percent data variance accounted for, with the top components accounting for a greater percentage of the channel data. To scroll through the data, use the `<<` and `>>` buttons in this window. These buttons will scroll both the component EEG data and the channel EEG data windows (C). Clicking the `| Update EEG Structure |` button in **component** EEG data window is the only way to save your decisions.

    <span style="color:green">B.</span> A figure that displays the ICLabel classification breakdown for each component.

    <span style="color:blue">C.</span> A window that shows the **channel** EEG data. It also contains an overlay feature that can be toggled on/off or updated while quality controlling. Use of this feature will be explained in subsequent lessons.

    <span style="color:yellow">D.</span> A figure that displays an array of squares corresponding to each 1-second epoch of each component. Each square is colored based on its activation difference from the mean.

    <span style="color:violet">E.</span> Window(s) with a topography for each component. The number label for each topography can be clicked to gain more information.

    <span style="color:orange">F.</span> Upon clicking a number label for a component a figure appears which displays the component's spectrum, dipole location, and a mini scroll plot of the full waveform of the selected component. More information on how to read this figure can be found in the [ICLabel Tutorial](https://labeling.ucsd.edu/tutorial/format).

> ## Note
> If you would like to cancel the QC procedure at anytime **without** saving the progress, you will need to force quit the QC script by typing **[Ctrl + C]** into the MATLAB command window.
